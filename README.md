The ChatBot EVE: a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet 🤖 I actually did not do this project entirely myself, but I got help from a youtube tutorial, and learned a lot from it.

# About this project 🚀
I actually did not do this project entirely myself, but I got help from a youtube tutorial, and learned a lot from it. Ann API was not used for this ChatBot. This ChatBot will understand you when you're greeting her. Like a "Hello", "Hi", "Hey", "Good morning", "Good day", ect. The same applies when writing valediction such as: "Bye", "Good bye", "Take Care", ect. It understands the game Rock-Paper-Scissors, curse words and you can even ask it, if it can tell a joke. You can also ask it for it's name and what it's favorite color is. If you're writing something that dosen't have an answer of it, the ChaBot will return it message to: "Try asking something else!". It was a fun project to make and also challenging. I learned also alot though.
